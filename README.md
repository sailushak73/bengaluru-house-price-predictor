# Bengaluru House Price Predictor

This is a machine learning project that predicts house prices in Bengaluru based on features like area (sq ft), number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, balconies, etc. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training a regression model using scikit-learn.

The trained model is saved using Pythonâ€™s pickle module and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can input property details through the web interface and get real-time price predictions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
- Machine learning model built with scikit-learn
- Model saved using pickle for reuse
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
